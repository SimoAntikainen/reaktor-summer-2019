## Excersise 1

<div>
{% include_relative small-multiples-excersise1.html %}
</div>

Small multiples visualization should offer an easy way to compare the different gathered data types and work with small mobile device screens. 
Idea was to show the biggest factor in climate change against factors, which do not explain the long upward trend. 

Data sources used allow their free use as long as they are properly referenced.

## Excersise 4

<div>
{% include_relative prediction-excersise4.html %}
</div>

For prediction an ARIMA time-series model was used as it is familiar with me through coursework. Pro's of this model are that it is easily explainable as the prediction depends only on
the past values of temperature anomaly. The model also takes a little time to fit and predict. 

Cons's of the model are related to the fact that it cannot take into account any exogenous data such as rising co2 concentration and solar activity. This is responsible for the low value of the prediciton. For this we could extend the model
from ARIMA to ARIMAX (X for exogenous variables), but then we would have to also make predictions on these exogenous variables, which add a degree of uncertanty to the model I do not have the expertice to evaluate. I have an separate repository of these failed models at https://github.com/SimoAntikainen/sarimax-climate-change-forecast.       

## Excersise 5

Simplest way to deliver the service would be to once a month
run a server-side python script with cron, Heroku scheduler etc, which scrapes new data from the sources and calculates new predictions based on this data. Then we could either update the Plotly.py visualization html files server side 
and serve them to the client, but this is not very economical because of the large file size of the created visualizations (around 2.8 mb). Therefore, a more economical option is to probably serve the data to the front-end via a REST-api and use Plotly.js JavaScript library to build the charts client side. Translating these charts from Plotly.py to Plotly.js should not take a long time from experience and should offer greater flexibility in customizing the charts for mobile devices.
